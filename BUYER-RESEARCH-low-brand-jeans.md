# BUYER RESEARCH: Low Brand Super Low Kick Jeans

## Section 0: The Avatar Hypothesis (THE SCOPE)
"I am researching **Gen Z / Young Millennial Women (18-29)** who love **the Y2K / 'It Girl' Aesthetic**, but are afraid of **Muffin Top and Constant Adjusting (The "Britney Low Rise" Trauma)**."

---

## Section 1.0: Deep Emotional Research (MANDATORY)

### 1. The "Friction" Search (Gap Analysis)
*   **Friction**: "I love the look but I hate pulling them up every 5 minutes."
*   **Friction**: "Low rise usually cuts right into my love handles giving me instant muffin top."
*   **Friction**: "They make my butt look flat and long ('sad butt')."

### 2. The "Insider Vocabulary" Mine (LSI Terms)
*   *Y2K, McBling, Hip Bones, Pelvic Cleavage (extreme), Stacked Hem, Kick Flare, Bootcut, Vintage Wash, Power Stretch, Contour Waist.*

### 3. The "Unanswered Question" Map
*   "Can I wear low rise if I have hip dips?"
*   "Will these show my underwear when I sit down?"
*   "Are these actually comfortable for sitting?"

### 4. Contrast Identification (The "Old Way")
*   **Contrast**: "Stiff, non-stretch vintage denim" (Unforgiving, uncomfortable) vs "High Waisted Mom Jeans" (Dated, hiding the body).

### 5. The "Why" Ladder (Root Cause Protocol)
*   Want Low Rise -> Why? To look trendy/Y2K -> Why? To show off figure -> Why? To feel confident and desirable -> Why? **To signal relevance and 'Main Character' Energy (Identity).**

### 6. The Tonal Calibration Check (CRITICAL)
*   **Tone**: "Your Cool Best Friend". Not overly salesy. Use Gen Z slang naturally ("Obsessed", "Slay", "Giving", "Iconic"). Empowering, not shaming.
